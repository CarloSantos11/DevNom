# DevNom is a fictional company

The idea is to create a service that allows us to pair learners with other learners as well as mentors with learners.
We will give users the ability to give their availability to program with others. They will have a dashboard of what they are currently working on as well as skills.

This benefits learners because it is more motivating to learn something with others. It's lonely and difficult to learn
completely on your own. Learning can feel isolated at times, it's nice to connect with others and learn from others.

This benefits mentors because they can find learners to work on their projects or help them create content.
